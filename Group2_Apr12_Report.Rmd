#Background 
In December 2019, numerous cases of an unknown respiratory virus were reported in the city of Wuhan, China. A coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent for the illness. This virus is closely related to SARS-CoV which was responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004. A pandemic was declared in March 2020 due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Other coronaviruses, NL63, 229E, HKU1, and OC43, cause common colds in humans. Coronaviruses are also present in various animals. We seek to address the following questions. 

#Questions
1. What is the evolutionary relationship among the human coronavirus strains?

2. What is the evolutionary relationship between the human and animal coronavirus strains?

3. To design a therapy (i.e., mRNA vaccine), which sequence would you target in hopes to carry over immunity between other strains as well?
